# Social-Distancing-using-YOLO-v3

# Problem Statement
The ongoing COVID-19 corona virus outbreak has caused a global disaster with its deadly 
spreading. social distancing is thought to be an adequate precaution (norm) against the 
spread of the pandemic virus. However, the general public is not used to keep an imaginary 
safety bubble around themselves. 

# Proposed Solution
With the help of this project, we can ensure that people follow the process of socialization. 
The purpose of this project is, therefore, to provide a deep learning platform for social 
distance tracking using an overhead perspective. The framework uses the YOLOv3 object 
recognition paradigm to identify humans in video sequences.  

# Uniqueness and Distinctive features of this project
The uniqueness of the project is that it shows the count of violating people all the time until 
the project is in running state, that means if the distance between two or more than two 
persons is less than 6 feet than a red box will appear that covers the person indicating that 
the person is violating the social distancing rule and those who are not violating will appear 
in green box. 
Our social distance prediction approach uses a pre-trained YOLOv3 object tracking 
algorithm for identifying people in an input video stream which produces favourable results 
for tracking social distancing in public spaces.
